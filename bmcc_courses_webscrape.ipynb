    "Here I will use a combination of the **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup** packages in python. First, I will select a specific department on the BMCC website. Then, I will obtain a list of links to every single course using Selenium. Afterwards, I will iterate through every link using BeautifulSoup in order to obtain the information for each course. I then use Selenium again to obtain course prerequistes that could not be obtained using BeautifulSoup. Finally, I will combine all of the course information into a single dataframe and export it as a csv file. \n",
